            <text class="card-name">Norfolk Island Pine (Araucaria heterophylla)</text>
            <div class="card-body">
                <p class="card-text">While most popular during the holiday season as a Christmas tree alternative, the Norfolk Island Pine looks gorgeous year round with its thin, needle-like leaves. This cone-bearing tree is actually a tropical plant that originates from Norfolk Island (hence the name), so it prefers temperatures between 65 and 85 degrees and can thrive in high humidity, according to The Sill. The indoor tree thrives in medium to bright, indirect light, but appreciates a few hours of direct sun.</p>

    <div class="card-shadow-sm">
        <text class="card-name">Money Tree (Pachira aquaticas)</text>
        <div class="card-body">
            <p class="card-text">Pachira thrives in more swamp-like situations similar to its original home in the South American wetlands. It can tolerate overwatering if there's good drainage and it appreciates bright, indirect light. You'll typically find it sold with a braided trunk under the name "money tree" due to its fortuitous associations in East Asia.</p>

    <div class="card-shadow-sm">
        <text class="card-name">Rubber Plant (Ficus elastica)</text>
        <div class="card-body">
            <p class="card-text">This tall and hardy beauty comes in many varieties, from tricolor and variegated leaves to almost black ones. Put yours in a spot with bright, indirect light and water it about once a week without water-logging, advises The Little Book of House Plants and Other Greenery.</p>

    <div class="card-shadow-sm">
        <text  class="card-name">Fiddle Leaf Fig (Ficus lyrata)</text>
        <div class="card-body">
            <p class="card-text">This uber-trendy plant keeps popping up in design magazines and chicly styled Instagram shots, thanks to its wide, textured leaves. Young plants feature dense foliage that spreads out as they age and grow more "tree-like." Give it bright, indirect light â€” near an east-facing window is perfect. Water once the top inch of soil is dry, drench until water comes out the bottom of the pot and then let it dry out again.</p>
